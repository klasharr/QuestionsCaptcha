Questions CAPTCHA module for Drupal 7
=====================================

This module adds a simple CAPTCHA form element to comment and contact forms offering the user a set of 'simple questions that he/she can check as TRUE or FALSE. Really they are statements rather than questions. It also adds a hidden honeypot field which has a configurable name.

To let particular user roles bypass the CAPTCHA, give them the 'bypass CAPTCHA' permission.

You can choose from a set of ten pre-written questions, decide how many to show to the user, add your own or use only your own via a api hook. As CAPTCHAs go, it is pretty basic but from my experience it will still block most comment spammers and it is something different.

But, it works, is a bit of fun and gives some Drupal APIs a bit of a workout. See it in action on my own site; http://www.klausharris.de , look at any page where there is a comment form.
